# Flow and participant observations

`dsf_model_collect` reads sources for `DsfFlow` and `DsfParticipant` subjects.
Provider resources use their own typed collectors. This module never creates
resource rows or dispatches actions; ModelSync's declared reactions record its
immutable `DsfObservation` results.

The source File contains `subject_type`, `subject_id`, `provider_id`,
`secret_name`, `interval_seconds` (60–86400), and `source`. The subject fields
must match ModelSync's `subject_type` and `resource_id`. Only real `DsfFlows` and
`DsfParticipants` routes are permitted.

Supported sources:

| `source.provider` | Fields | Subject |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github` | `owner`, `repository`, `git_ref` | DsfFlow |
| `datadog` | `site`, `app_key_secret`, `query`, `window_seconds`, `max_age_seconds` | DsfFlow |
| `dsf_operations` | `service`, `environment`, `max_age_seconds` | DsfFlow or DsfParticipant |

GitHub observations retain the exact resolved commit, tree, and commit time.
They omit author details and commit messages. Datadog observations retain bounded
numeric points and the exact query/window. A zero is a measured value; no numeric
points are absence of data, and old points are stale data. Neither condition
asserts an outage. A metric query does not create or impersonate a Datadog monitor.

Operational snapshots use the authenticated DSF endpoint with
`participant_limit=200&job_limit=20`. The returned participant cursor becomes
ModelSync's `source_cursor`, which the next collection passes as
`participant_cursor`. The final page clears the cursor so the next cycle starts
at the beginning. Each page records its start and next cursor in a separate
immutable observation. A last page after a nonempty start cursor is not described
as a complete inventory, and this module never replaces or deletes participant
rows from a partial page. Agents reconcile those explicit observations with the
application model.

The parser checks snapshot version, service/environment, echoed page limits,
source timestamp, revision format, and cursor shape. Unknown product fields are
omitted. Provider errors record access status without response bodies or secrets.
Host failures that cannot produce a safely bound callback remain visible through
the integration failure and existing ModelSync retry behavior.
