# Search combinations and audit worlds

The completed 303-question run contained 41 hypotheses and five composed worlds,
but no relationship or conditional-event checks. Every world received only a gap
classification and likelihood. Its 24 revisions did not establish that any
specific uncertainty had been resolved. The UI's inferred “gaps cleared” counter
therefore described neither research progress nor a verified resolution.

## Decision

Keep the native SemanticRun entity and WASM integrations. After exploration,
schedule compatibility questions across the current hypothesis frontier before
asking the writer to compose worlds. Cover pairs in round-robin order under the
remaining question budget. Build candidate sets from pairwise-compatible events
using different starting points. Retain all frontier events and unresolved pair
judgments in the composition input; a surprising idea is not discarded because
its probability or compatibility is uncertain. These candidate sets are search
seeds, not an exhaustive enumeration or a proof of joint consistency.

Each world must contain several facets, explicit assumptions and a connected,
dated chain of defining events. Facet names emerge from the question; there are
no prescribed economic, political, optimistic or pessimistic buckets. Validate
references, coverage, acyclicity and deadline ordering deterministically.
Source-support links are distinct from future causal prerequisites.

Jev evaluates all component pairs under the world's assumptions, every stated
transition, and the whole world jointly. The whole-set check can identify
contradictions that pairwise tests miss. For each transition, assess the target
both conditional on all explicit prerequisites occurring and conditional on
their conjunction failing. These are conditional model judgments, not identified
causal effects. Do not condition on the target or on its downstream consequences.
Never multiply these diagnostics into a world probability. The existing fresh
whole-world estimate runs after the audits and receives their results.

Conflicts or material unknowns return to composition with their exact subjects
and judgments. Revised worlds have immutable identities; previous worlds and
receipts remain in history. Bound this loop to three compositions and the actual
remaining budget. Unfinished audits stay explicit; a world revision never counts
as an uncertainty resolved. Active-world IDs determine the final answer.

Independent structural questions share provider requests, following the
[documented fan-out interface](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/fan-out).
Validate the complete response before advancing the cursor. Each question keeps
its own answer, task, evidence context and request hashes, with a shared HTTP
call ID. The UI counts Jev checks separately from provider requests. Dependent
node decisions and whole-world likelihoods remain sequential.

When source evidence changes, requeue the same hypotheses' gap and likelihood
questions and clear their stale current results. Preserve the previous answers
in the trace. Evidence additions and revised possibilities are shown as research
progress; there is no inferred “gaps cleared” count.

## Verification and limits

Tests reject cycles, impossible date order, disconnected chains, missing facet
coverage, malformed fan-out answers and invalid subject references. Higher-order
conflicts must trigger fresh composition even when every pair was compatible.
Conditional requests must exclude the target from their conditioning set.
Actual WASM integration tests exercise the native handoffs. Browser verification
distinguishes synthetic layout fixtures from provider-generated output.

“No conflict found” means no conflict was found in the recorded checks. It is not
proof, forecast calibration, or an exhaustive search. Worlds may overlap, so
their probabilities do not form a distribution summing to one. This change does
not yet maintain a claim-specific ledger proving that research questions were
answered; unknowns remain visible rather than being counted as cleared.
