         known failure mode: the session can mark complete without running it.\n\
         - Use MANY SMALL execute() calls across turns. Each script should do ONE step only: \
         create 1-2 EventNodes, OR temper.list to verify, OR temper.write the skeleton, OR \
         temper.action SeedComplete, OR temper.done — never combine these in one script.\n\
         - After every create batch, run a separate execute() that only calls \
         temper.list(\"EventNodes\", \"world_id eq '{world_id}'\") and prints the count.\n\
         - Only call temper.done(\"complete\") in its own final execute(), after SeedComplete \
         returns successfully.\n\n\
         For each determined fact, create an EventNode:\n\
         temper.create(\"EventNodes\", {{\"world_id\": \"{world_id}\", \"statement\": \"...\", \
         \"layer\": \"slow|mid\", \"probability\": \"1.0\", \"provenance\": \"determined\", \

         \"author_agent_id\": \"{agent_id}\"}})\n\
         Aim for 8-20 load-bearing facts, slow layer first. Every statement needs a source.\n\n\
         THEN name the 3-5 load-bearing UNCERTAINTY AXES of this domain (ADR-006): the \
         dimensions on which {target_date} genuinely FORKS — not determined, the questions \
         whose answers most change the world. For each, give a short axis name and the \
         CONSENSUS POLE (what most informed observers currently expect). These are the \
         dimensions the engine will sample diverse futures across, so make them orthogonal \
         and genuinely contested — not restatements of one another.\n\n\
         Then temper.write(\"/skeleton.md\", \"<markdown summary>\") — the ONLY way to create \
         a file. Do NOT create Files, Directories, or Workspaces yourself.\n\
         temper.write returns {{\"file_id\": \"...\"}}. In a separate execute(), call \
         temper.action(\"Worlds\", \"{world_id}\", \"SeedComplete\", {{\"skeleton_node_count\": \

Build an open research map that can support genuinely different causal futures. Let the
question and discovered evidence determine what to investigate. There is no prescribed
topic checklist, axis count, branch count, consensus pole, or required narrative. Revise
your framing when evidence points somewhere unexpected. A dated commitment is one kind
of evidence, not the boundary of the research. Explore observed changes, contested claims,
weak signals, counterexamples and emerging mechanisms when they bear on this question.
Distinguish an observation from its interpretation and from a hypothesis about the future.
A source's prediction is evidence that the source made that prediction, not that it is true.
Identify competing causal explanations and novel hypotheses worth testing. Preserve
contradictions, uncertainty, missing evidence and the reasons a finding could mislead us.
Do not turn a disagreement or an unsourced possibility into an established fact.

{research}
--- BEGIN CORPUS ---
{corpus_inline}
--- END CORPUS ---

Persist useful research as it emerges so the person can watch it build. Use the exact API:
temper.create("EventNodes", {{"world_id": "{world_id}", "statement": "<finding, date, scope, uncertainty and competing interpretation>", "layer": "mid", "probability": "", "provenance": "observed", "source_refs": "[\"<URL or corpus reference with a short supporting quotation and source date>\"]", "resolve_by": "{target_date}", "author_agent_id": "{agent_id}"}})
Use provenance observed, contested, weak_signal, or hypothesis to identify the claim's
status. Use determined only for an actually fixed fact. Leave probability empty for research
claims: unknown does not mean 0.5 and sourced does not mean 1.0. A genuinely quoted,
quantified forecast may use provenance market or authored with its stated probability;
identify whose estimate it is, its horizon and its conditions in the statement.
Hypotheses may cite their motivating evidence, but explicitly say they are inferred and
unverified; never fabricate a source for the hypothesis. If no source was available, say so
and use an empty source_refs array. Preserve enough actual source content to let subsequent
evaluations assess what was observed. Do not pad the map to a target count or collapse
conflicting observations to one consensus. Group only genuinely redundant findings.

The session uses a Monty execute REPL. Work in incremental execute calls: research, persist
findings, inspect the saved EventNodes, then continue investigating. Avoid one monolithic
script; check action results before moving on. You have an operational turn budget, so leave
time to save partial findings and report remaining research questions honestly.
Verify saved nodes with temper.list("EventNodes", "world_id eq '{world_id}'").
Write the research map, competing explanations, new hypotheses, evidence limitations and
unanswered questions using temper.write("/skeleton.md", "<research map markdown>").
This legacy filename is storage only; it does not constrain the substance of the research.
Do NOT create Files, Directories, or Workspaces yourself. Save the returned file_id.
Then in a separate execute call use:
temper.action("Worlds", "{world_id}", "SeedComplete", {{"skeleton_node_count": "<actual saved count>", "graph_snapshot_file_id": "<returned file_id>", "uncertainty_axes": "[]"}})
The empty legacy uncertainty_axes field deliberately does not preselect the futures.
Only after SeedComplete succeeds, call temper.done("complete") in its own execute call.
