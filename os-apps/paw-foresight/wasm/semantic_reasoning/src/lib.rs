const EXPLORATION_PROMPT: &str = r#"Construct genuinely different causal futures as possible answers to the user's question in state.world.description as future event hypotheses for Jev to evaluate. Begin from what is observed at world.last_ingest_date and what the user assumes, then reason about what could become different by world.target_date.

Existing roles and workflows are not default invariants. Today's way of accomplishing something is one arrangement, not a requirement the future must preserve. Identify the assumptions that make that arrangement necessary. Ask what happens if an assumption changes, what would cause that change, and what people could then do that they cannot do now. Follow the consequences until the hypothesis changes the answer to the user's question. Equally consider why the change might fail or reverse. Neither preserving nor eliminating today's arrangements is a required conclusion.

Build hypotheses from causal reasoning; they need not already appear in a source. Label conjectural premises honestly. Evidence constrains their plausibility, not which possibilities you are allowed to formulate. Use research where it can distinguish competing explanations or test an important premise. A missing citation is not an instruction to replace an interesting possibility with a familiar outcome with easier citations. Jev will assess likelihood separately; do not supply probabilities.

Use the catalog to avoid repeating work, not as the agenda for the next round. Retain alternatives with different mechanisms even when they overlap. State the specific future change, the causal chain and what could prevent it. Give a short imagined scene of the resulting life in plain language. Details in the scene are illustrations, not extra predictions.

Research contract: use available read-only temper.web_search and temper.web_fetch. Prefer direct temper.web_fetch(url); web_fetch accepts only a URL. On failure, web_search result's text field may contain bounded source-extracted text. Report only claims and quotations actually contained in that returned text, never infer them from titles, URLs or search summaries. Label indexed-excerpt evidence, direct-fetch failure and date/context limits; use weak_signal when context remains unverified. Fetch smaller article/text-version URLs only when actually discovered. Keep publication dates distinct from retrieval dates, and old findings distinct from the observed present. For frozen hindcasts, return research_evidence=[] and use only supplied evidence within the vantage; later remembered knowledge is inadmissible. Report tool failures and contradictory evidence honestly. A citation or Jev label does not prove a future.

Return JSON ONLY: {"hypotheses":[{"id":"unique-ascii-id","title":"concise distinct hypothesis","statement":"self-contained observable future event with actors and horizon","mechanism":"how and why it could happen, including the causal assumptions","requires":["existing node ID or new hypothesis/evidence ID whose truth this mechanism actually requires"],"parent":"optional existing or same-batch hypothesis ID when meaningfully extending or revising it","scene":"short imagined moment showing how a person lives or works if this exact event happens; not an observation","signal":"optional observable early signal","falsifier":"optional disconfirming observation","evidence_note":"what supports or challenges the mechanism and what is still conjecture","research_question":"optional consequential unanswered question"}],"research_evidence":[{"id":"unique-ascii-id","statement":"finding with date, scope, uncertainty and conflicting interpretation where relevant","url":"exact retrieved HTTPS URL","quote":"short supporting excerpt, maximum 25 words and 200 characters per source","observed_at":"YYYY-MM-DD","provenance":"observed|contested|weak_signal"}],"continue_exploring":true,"exploration_note":"what this exploration learned, which framing changed, and why another round would or would not be useful"}.

Reference contract: existing catalog nodes use exact ref_ identifiers; never reconstruct UUIDs. New ASCII IDs must be unique and must not begin ref_. requires contains only existing or same-batch IDs whose events the mechanism actually requires; use [] when none are identified. parent is optional exact lineage, not proof. Keep sourced observations separate from hypothetical implications. Source URLs must be retrieved HTTPS URLs. Quotes are at most25 words and200 characters per source.

Resource contract: at most128 TOTAL hypotheses plus research_evidence per batch; capacity5000 Jev calls,2048 nodes,64 rounds and one hour. These are limits, not targets or category counts. Continue while another round can add a materially different mechanism or resolve a consequential uncertainty. Stop with continue_exploring=false when it cannot, explaining why and what remains unknown. A budget stop means incomplete exploration, not convergence."#;

const WORLD_COMPOSITION_PROMPT: &str = r#"Turn the explored evidence and possibilities into a few genuinely different WORLDS that answer the user's question. The small nodes are building blocks, not the final answer. Find coherent combinations and causal chains: what people do, what becomes cheap or scarce, who gains or loses, what disappears, and what changes next. Do not turn each node into a separate world or split one familiar lesson into several cards. A world is more than a themed list. Its defining changes must fit together and have a clear reason to occur together. Consider rival mechanisms and evidence that challenges the combination. Do not force an optimistic/pessimistic/middle template, a compliance split, or the same axes for every question.

Begin with the present at world.last_ingest_date. Separate supported observations, assumptions supplied by the user, and unresolved facts. A practice already common in the relevant setting is the starting point, not a future breakthrough. Describe what changes AFTER that starting point. Do not universalize a user's own workflow or an early-adopter example to everyone. Source retrieval dates are not publication dates. If current evidence is missing, state that plainly. The final worlds should differ in consequences and ways of living, not only in speed of adoption.

Choose 2–6 distinct worlds, a compact answer rather than a quota to fill. Use only exact existing ref_ IDs for components and challenges. A component is a defining future change, not merely a source citation. Do not pick unrelated claims to make a story look rich. Do not invent new core events at this stage: they would bypass exploration. Build layered worlds, not lists of jobs or themed suggestions. Give each world 3–12 distinct facets: dimensions of everyday life or software that emerge from its actual changes, without a prescribed topic list. Each facet links its defining components. Give 2–24 explicit causal links between components, with a mechanism and date by which the link operates. Links form a connected directed prerequisite graph covering every component; do not create cycles. Each link has a distinct consequence to_id; combine its prerequisite from_ids into that link. Every component also belongs to a facet. Link dates must respect causal ordering. State assumptions separately. Use combination_search and world_audits as recorded model judgments: they are not proof. When prior worlds are challenged, construct revised worlds that address or openly retain the specific conflicts and unknowns. Never claim a check ran unless its actual result is supplied. If exploration is weak or stopped early, say so in the baseline unknowns and the narratives. Each world will receive its OWN fresh Jev evaluation of the whole joint event, including dependencies and counterevidence. Never supply probabilities or combine the component estimates yourself. These worlds may overlap; they are not a complete partition of every possible future."#;

const WRITING_STYLE: &str = r#"Write for a curious person outside the industry. Be direct, concrete and easy to picture. No corporate language, news roundups, slogans or unexplained professional shorthand. Say what a person does, buys, stops needing or notices on an ordinary day. A scene is explicitly imagined, not evidence. A title makes a clear claim; it does not name a management theme. Explain why in familiar words, including what could stop it. Do not exaggerate to sound ambitious. Translate technical terms: suggested code changes, the project's code, who can see private data, connections to other tools. If a technical name is essential, explain it. Keep short paragraphs and avoid repeating the same point in every field."#;

The worlds have already been constructed and evaluated separately. Return one outcome for each supplied world, preserving its defining event, components and challenges. Do not invent, merge or split worlds at this writing step. Explain the different lives they imply, the causal path, and what could break each one. Start beyond what the baseline says is already happening. Present a few distinct worlds in plain, vivid prose rather than a summary of industry news. Explain how their supplied facets and causal chains interact. Distinguish recorded consistency judgments, conditional estimates, unresolved issues and whole-world odds. Do not claim uncertainty was resolved or consistency proven merely because an audit ran. Refinement rounds are repeated model judgments about the same world, not independent evidence. Stable scores do not establish accuracy; preserve incomplete rounds and the engine's stop reason.

The engine attaches the baseline, exact world definition, component and challenge links, facets, causal chain, assumptions, recorded audit and evaluation status, and each world's own Jev estimate. Do not supply a probability or infer one from component odds. Missing world evaluation means unknown odds, never zero or fifty percent. Whole-world estimates are uncalibrated and worlds may overlap: do not normalize them to 100 percent or present them as exhaustive. A stopped or incomplete search must remain explicit. A low estimate can still describe an important alternative. The goal is a few understandable worlds, not a ranking of isolated predictions."#;
