# Plan

## What we are addressing

ARN-518 adds actual continuous learning and an understandable UI to the existing Foresight app. The end state is the complete verified flow described in spec.md, shown to the user before visual refinement.

## Implementation

1. Implement the learner as bounded pure Rust shared by WASM integrations and deterministic tests. Establish failing acceptance tests for temporal separation, improvement/rejection, replay determinism and malformed or simulated evidence.
2. Express learning preparation, fitting, evaluation and adoption in Temper entities and callbacks. Preserve an immutable run record and versioned parameters. Connect recorded outcomes to learning and adopted models to prediction revisions.
3. Add a focused Foresight workspace to the authenticated Svelte dashboard. Reuse OData and SSE. Build world, prediction, activity and learning views and controls against the actual app contracts.
4. Run the real app and dashboard in the governed execution environment. Drive the complete flow and validate persistence, failure states, duplicate delivery and stale candidate behavior. Record evidence and any necessary implementation decisions as they arise.
5. Run the configured review panel, triage within accepted scope, complete required checks, publish the app to Genesis and deploy the dashboard through the governed release. Verify the installed version, live user flow and Datadog evidence. Show the working result.

## Delivery priority

Complete one usable learning and observation flow first. Keep presentation simple and readable using the existing dashboard plus the Galley design tokens. Defer decorative refinement, not required behavior or correctness.

## Approved delivery acceleration

Publish accepted path predictions as they become available. Reduce the initial exploration to three futures with up to three key claims each, followed by one repair-and-challenge pass per claim. Start bounded deeper searches after the first result is usable. Preserve saved paths and prediction history. Repair provider protocol and recovery failures before timing a fresh complete run; report actual first-prediction and first-pass elapsed times separately from implementation time.
