# ARN-461 spec

> Historical September 3 contract: the initial Temper-row CI migration was installed only in TemperPaw. The September 10 repair below preserves explicit legacy comment consumers in Stack and Temper, prevents helper writes to the wrong backend, and repairs public Temper recording. It does not claim that all repositories have completed the migration.


## Door

`PassReview`, `AttachProofPacket`, and `Merge` stay the verbs. The implementer still fires them. The machine does not believe the declaration.

| Verb | WASM | Looks at | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| PassReview | `chain_review_ready` | Effort `review_run_ids` | RetractReviewPassed |
| AttachProofPacket | `chain_proof_ready` | the attached ProofPacket | RetractProofAttached |
| Merge | `chain_merge_ready` | both, plus `head_sha` | RetractMerge |

Each module GETs sibling rows over `/tdata`. It does not dispatch. It does not scrape GitHub.

## Review rules (same as `stack/review/validate.py`)

Across the attached ReviewRuns that are `Recorded` with `record_present`:

- `commit` is a 40-char lowercase hex sha, and every run shares it
- mandatory model reviewers from `review/panel.json` (`grok`, `codex`, `fable`) — at least two of three present on `reviewer_id` or `reviewers_ran`
- no `fix_it_failed`
- no unresolved `act-on` finding (recomputed from `findings`, not from `open_act_on_count`)

`RecordPanel` may write `commit`, `reviewers_ran`, `findings`, and `risk` so one action is enough. `IngestRecord` stays for the comment shadow.

## Proof rules (same as `stack/proof/validate.py`)

The attached ProofPacket is `Recorded` with `record_present`. Its `commit` / `changed_surface` / `blast_radius` / `features` / `tests` / `independent_verifier` pass the ingest proof shape: changed+blast rerun, verifier agrees, no failing feature, tests pass.

## Merge

Guards stay the existing bools. After the transition, `chain_merge_ready` checks the rows again and pins `commit` to Merge `head_sha`. Failure returns Proving and clears `review_passed` and `proof_attached`. Merge still does not call GitHub.

## CI

`sdlc-review.yml` and `sdlc-verification.yml` ask production Temper for ReviewRuns / ProofPackets whose `commit` equals the PR head. They do not read a hidden PR comment. A walked Effort with Recorded rows is enough. No record on Temper fails closed.

## Out of scope

`review_gate_lifecycle` is unchanged. Genesis publish is a later walk.

## September 10 acceptance cases

- A registered harness can submit passing and failing review evidence; a failed result remains failed.
- An ordinary authorized implementer can submit raw proof JSON through the existing validator and reach Recorded only when validation passes. Direct validation callbacks remain unavailable to that implementer.
- Evidence upload produces a real Ready File with matching bytes; metadata-only creation never counts as proof.
- A denial tells the client whether human elicitation is available and why delivery failed. Task consent never silently becomes a Cedar grant.
- An authenticated human arbitration outcome can authorize a bounded terminal check, bound to repository, PR and head, without fabricating reviewers. Default review requirements remain unchanged.
- Shared submission helpers and migrated CI read the same Temper evidence. Older comment-only gates have explicit migration handling.
- Tooling-only installation has honest completion evidence; no fabricated application image deployment.
